Agent definitions — each agent is a named retrieval+generation mode.
Only the system prompt and a few knobs change; the retrieval pipeline is shared.

Each agent dict carries:
    name, category, icon, description, placeholder  — UI metadata
    top_k                                           — retrieval depth
    examples                                        — UI example prompts
    system                                          — Ollama system message
    instruction                                     — appended to the user prompt
    cite_required (optional, default True)          — whether the citation
        validator should flag [n] markers not present in the retrieved
        set. Prose-drafting agents (writing) set this False because they emit
        placeholder markers like [ref]/[X] by design.
    skill (optional)                                — id of a skill pack in
        Local_Rag/rag/skills/. When set, resolve_system() appends a
        section-specific brief assembled by skills.loader on top of the agent's
        own system prompt. The brief is built per request (it depends on which
        manuscript section is being written), which is why callers must go
        through resolve_system() rather than reading agent["system"] directly.

    "a measurement; report concentration retained, size, zeta potential, or "
    "dissolution rate instead.\n"
    "- Calibrate hedging to evidence: direct claims when data are strong "
    "('X leads to Y'); 'can be attributed to' / 'is likely due to' for "

    "Do not over-hedge.\n"
